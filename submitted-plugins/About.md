# Overview #

If you wish to improve or add a new plugin, submit your pull request
to this directory.

Same guidelines apply here as to wrapper code in general (see 
contributer guidelines).  Additionally, your plugin should 
perform reasonable error checks or be able to handle improper
player/operator input during plugin execution without causing
a wrapper/plugin crash.

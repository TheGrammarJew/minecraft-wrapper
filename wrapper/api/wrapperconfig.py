*wrapperconfig.py is the default config file.  Changes made
here are inserted or deleted from the the wrapper config
each time wrapper starts.*

*Items marked as "deprecated" get removed from the wrapper
config when wrapper starts.  These are are not valid items.
they only exist so that they will get removed from older
wrapper versions.  This is intended to keep the actual
wrapper.config.json file from getting cluttered with old
unused items.*

*The wrapper.config.json file contents will look like this,
but without all the comment lines.*

    This class is normally passed as an argument to an event
    callback, but can be also be called using getPlayer(username):

    .. code:: python

        player = self.api.getPlayer(<username>)

    ..

    Player objects contains methods and data of a currently
    logged-in player. This object is destroyed
    upon logging off.  Most features are tied heavily to
    proxy mode implementations and the proxy client instance.

    The player object has a self.__str___ representation that returns the
    player.username.  Therefore, plugins do not need to attempt string
    conversion or do explicit references to player.username in their code
    (str(player) or player.username in plugin code).

    When using events, events in the "proxy" (Group 'Proxy') section are only
    available in proxy mode.  "server" events (Group 'core/mcserver.py')
    are available even without proxy mode, as long as the server is running.

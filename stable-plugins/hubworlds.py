DESCRIPTION = """
The hubworlds plugin is a sample plugin that demonstrates wrapper 
hubs and can be modified for use in your own server(s).  This sample
 setup assumes 4 worlds:\n
 1) The main online mode wrapper and it's wrapped server, on 
 whichever ports you prefer...\n
 2) 'world1p' is another offline wrapper running on port 25611.  'world1 
 directly connects to world1p's server running on 26510, by-passing it's 
 proxy mode.  This is just for demo purposes - you probably don't want 
 to do this; it will confuse wrapper since it will not be able to see 
 the player objects!\n3) world2 - an unwrapped server.\n
 4) Another server with no wrapper.
 
 You can replace worlds 2 and 3 with any server or wrapper you 
 like.  The actual world names on disk can be whatever you like.
 
 Sometimes, you don't spawn correctly, this can usually be corrected 
 by running /hub and trying again."""

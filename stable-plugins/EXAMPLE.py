# The Wrapper 1.0.0 rc release is not backwards compatible with the pre-release plugin with respect to storages:
#  * The original API returned a "storage object" which operated (but was not actually) similar to a 
#    python dict(), but (incompletely/poorly) implemented dictionary protocols, but added a 
#    periodic save method to store the data to disk every so many seconds in a json format (with
#    associated json limitations on data types and field keys).
#  * The newer API (still prerelease) removed the automatic periodic save methods and required the 
#    plugin to call the storage's save() or close() method during the onDisable event.
#  * The API now creates a "storage object" which CONTAINS a dictionary called "Data".  The object 
#    still has a save() method, but no periodic save.  The save also uses Pickle formatting by default
#    (although json formatting can be specified).
# - Storages require a close() method to save their contents to disk. save() still works, but the storage can remain
#   open after the plugin disables, resulting in memory leakages and inconsistent disk storage content.  close() also
#   performs a save().

# Items outside the formal API (accessing wrapper/server/proxy/etc methods directly) are not supported.  Wrapper's own
# internal classes and methods have been fully re-written and refactored with no support for the prior code.
#
# desiring to maintain backwards-compatibility in wrapper's API means maintaining the camelCase tradition for the API.
# This reasoning is considered by PEP-8 to be a valid reason for non-compliance with the PEP.

    class 'Main' is what wrapper imports.  The normal steps are:
    1) Wrapper loads the plugin and reads the CONSTANTS above to determine the plugin's ID and any dependencies.
    2) If there are dependencies, it loads those first.
    3) It then instantiates this class Main. (the dependencies are now __init__'ed and onEnable'd at this point...)
    4) It stores the plugin metadata in wrapper's Plugin's dictionary.

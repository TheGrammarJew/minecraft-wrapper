#Roadmap#
Here's a list of planned updates and the improvements that they may contain.

*Actual Release (1.0.0)*
- Nothing yet

*Planned Changes*
- Dashboard changes [slated for RC only]:
  - Redesign interface (use SB-Admin 2.0 template as inspiration/base) and backend
    - Move over to websockets
    - Split multiple pages, use template system (possibly use Flask?)
  - Ability to modify server.properties with nice graphical settings
  - Rename files, edit text files, upload files, unzip/untar, etc. through file manager
  - Manage backups and backup settings through interface
    - Rollback to an existing backup with one click
    - Click button to force instant backup
    - See current backup status (and see when upcoming backup occurs)
  - Show faces in userlist without proxy mode, and cache locally
  - Update Wrapper.py with button, and see list of changes through interface
  - Real-time world map with players' positions and such
  - [x] ~~Encrypt passwords in wrapper.properties.json~~ complete
  - Allow for changing password from page itself and console
  - View log files from server and wrapper
- Proxy changes:
  - Support Forge 1.7.10 and Forge 1.8.x
  - Parse chunk packets, block packets, etc. and remember them for API usage
  - Allow connections without authentication in proxy-mode from other wrapper.py instances using player.connect() with an
   authentication key for the sake of having multiple servers without having to put the wrappers themselves all in offline mode
- Other changes:
  - "Sleep mode" for proxy mode, where server is -STOP'd to conserve CPU power when nobody is online
    - Alternative method that would work without proxy mode: Letting the server run, but limiting CPU power massively until someone logs in
  - Properly centralize UUID code - make a nice, centralized method of obtaining UUIDs regardless if proxy mode is enabled or not, and whether we're in offline mode or not

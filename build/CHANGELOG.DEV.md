Build 5
- Bugfix - name changes were not actually working (old name persisted).
- improved name changes to include offline hubs being able to update names too!
  : whitelist warning : Names are still whitelisted by offline name. An
   automatic name change will cause player to not be whitelisted (you will
   have to `whitelist add` the new name).

Starting with:
Build 0 [1.0.2 RC 4] - Development branch update

Build 255 (next build)
- player to player TP - Add inter-dimensional TP (1.8+) api
  Community Input enhancement proxy mode

Build 254 [0.15.0] - Master branch update
- Correct one other Python 2/3 error in IRC
- Add explanatory comments about player object usage in strings
- Add warning log about web mode being presently broken
- Build master branch to [0.15.0]

Build 253
- Correct Python 3 errors in IRC

Build 252
-correct password decryting errors in IRC
- IRC now works in PY2 only (unicode related issues in PY3)

Build 251
- bugfixes in config and remove test code
- apparently, Spigot/Mcbans needs more time to kick the players before
 a server restart...

Build 250
- Fix custom messages again for non-proxy mode.

Build 249
- add config items to allow entering a plaintext password that
 gets digested and resaved with encryption.
- PEP-8 updates to dashboard (still not usable yet)
- Fix error that prevented startup if user did not have cryptography
 installed.

Build 248
- This build fixes [issue 492](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/issues/492):
    - Fix timer loops for reboots
    - Fix custom messages in Misc section and add new message "halt-message"
     for when wrapper is halted.

Build 247 [0.14.2] dev
- For consistency and eliminate confusion, all wrapper internal
 encryption uses `cryptography` package even for regular hashing
 and password checking.
- retained bcrypt package as on option, but it will likely only ever
 be a part of the plugin API.
- added plugin API (base.py) password handler functions:
  ```
      def hash_password(self, password):
         """ Bcrypt-based password encryption.  Takes a raw string password
         returns a string representation of the binary hash."""

      def check_password(self, password, hashed_password):
         """ Bcrypt-based password checker.  Takes a raw string password and
         compares it to the hash of a previously hashed password, returning
         True if the passwords match, or False if not.
  ```

Build 246 [0.14.1] Dev
- fix error in core/wrapper.py that causes spamming of "Disabling proxy
 mode because ..." to the console.
- added text to the vanilla message to tell console user not only the
 port of the minecraft server, but the proxy too (if proxy is enabled).
- added module `wrapper/utils/crypt.py` with full featured password encryption schemas:
    - `make_hash(password_string, encoding='utf-8')` - hash a password
    - `check_pw(password_string, hashed_pw_str, encoding='utf-8')` check password against hash
    - `phrase_to_url_safebytes(pass_phrase)` - create bytes for Fernet encryption from wrapper pass phrase
    - `encrypt(passphrase, data)` - do a Fernet encrypt of data from bytes pass phrase
    - `decrypt(passphrase, encrypted_str_data)` - Fernet decryption of data
- implement a wrapper password to be used internally by wrapper to
 store sensitive data (email passwords) that wrapper's features may use.
- implement encryption hashing of other stored passwords to disk
 (web, IRC, so forth.. ).
- corrected Web/dashboard and IRC password references to use hashed
 passwords.
- Added /password command to wrapper to allow setting of encrypted
 passwords in the wrapper.config.json file.
** important note ** I may consider uniting make_hash/encrypt so that a single schema is used in the next build

Build 245 [0.14.1] - Master branch update
- fix spigot login position (due to spigot pre-pending the world name to
 the player coordinates).
- while at that, add IP address to player object from login text (so that
 non-proxy wrapper's have the player IP address).
- build a master branch with dev fixes after build 239 (especially due to
 broken wrapper update stuff).

Build 244 [0.14.0] - Development branch
- (finally) fix chat_to_client() so that json is messaged properly.
- fix update code in core/wrapper.  changed the config items slightly.
- expanded capabilities of player message to send messages above XP bar (proxy mode)

Build 241
- fix chat_to_client() so that json is messaged properly.  Past couple
builds broke advanced json chat things (like links and hoverevents).

Build 240
- more cleanup for PING requests.
- fix bugs in player.message() displays I introduced in Build 238/239.

Build 239 [0.13.6] - Development branch
- bump version

Build 238
-fix new bug from bugfix for Spigot in build #237 that introduced new
error preventing vanilla proxy server connections.
-refactoring proxy again:
    - removed "lobby" references from serverconnection: "LOBBY" could
    never be a real state for server connection since LOBBY is not a real
    server.  It is just a state in which client connection is active with
    NO current server.  clientconnection.py is the valid place to
    handle "lobby" states.
    - clean up clientconnection references to closing server connections
    - clean up serverconnection and parse_cb to remove old unused stuff.
    - turn off proxy entity filtering when entity controls are disabled.
    - remove logging/console output for "PING REQUEST" connections.
    - refactor/rename client methods to be more/better descriptive.  For
    instance, client_logon() to Logon_client_into_proxy() to show that
    the client has not logged into a server yet, just into the wrapper proxy.
    - clean up clientconnection and parse_sb to remove unused stuff.
    - clean up the program flow for disconnections in serverconnection and
    clientconnection.
    - fix keepalive process to stop as soon as client aborts.  Ensure
    a prompt abort signal for terminated connections.
    - make normal debug messages look more like prose and less "scary".
    reserve full bebug style messages for unexpected items/errors.
    - improve player/client logout process to clean player and client
    objects out reliably.  Client is only removed when the client proxy
    flush loop ends and the player object is removed at the mcserver.py
    logout().
    - re-add parse_play_player_position to parse_sb.py
    - re-implement "silent-ipbans" option.
    - beef up chat_to_server() method (the backend for api.player say() and
    execute() methods) to prevent a chat message being sent over 100 or 256
    characters, as applicable to the minecraft version.
    - added a chat_to_client() method to clientconnection.py as the
    preferred backend for player.message() when in proxy mode.

Build 237
Improve the non-proxy event section some.
- Add player.teleport event (core/mcserver.py)
- API for getPosition and getDimension given non-proxy functionality:
    -getPosition(): will return whatever position was last returned when
     a player was teleported.
    -getDimension just returns the overworld (versus returning nothing)
- Upgraded the homes plugin to a more robust version that can work without
  proxy mode and has administrative functions to list and manage homes on
  a server.

Build 235 [0.13.6] - master branch (stable)
- Bugfix for Spigot servers.  An old attempt to fix colorization on
  Spigot servers backfired on the newer builds.  I removed the
  offending code in core/mcserver.py

Build 234
- change parsing for server bound PlayerPosLook.  Stop using "NULL"
  element for 1.8+ parsing and just use if else to determine data element
  positions.  I suspect the null component may be bugged or causing
  parsing problems.

Build 233 [0.13.5] - master branch (stable)
- Fix minecraft.rst document header caused by module containind the name
  "class". renamed proxy/entityclasses to entitybasics.
- more touch ups to documentation.
- pushed to master because there are nice bugfixes.

Build 232
- improve /perms:
    - reimplement RESET command
    - add individual, all user, and groups reset methods to the API
- some refactoring of command processing portions of wrapper.py, commands.py.
- various bugfixes to bugs I created.
- move pickling methods to the helpers API
- clean up documentation some more.

Build 229-230 [0.13.4] - master branch (stable)

Build 229 [0.13.4]
- Bugfix in SB Parse.
- Fixed keepalives to prevent player timeouts with slow connections

Build 228 [0.13.4]
- Fix more code in Proxy server/client parsing to improve speed and
 reliablity for slow connection users.
- Fix SB Parse error in yaw/pitch for 1.8+ playerposlook (create parser)

Build 226 [0.13.3]
- Fix bugs for 1.12.2 (Change of parsing for keep alive)

Build 225 [0.13.2]
- fix bug in last build with proxy handle()s.

Build 223
- improve core.storage handling of cases where pickle is used and storage
 attempts to load any old json file.  No longer generates error just
 because there is not an old json version.
- clarify api.helpers getjsonfile() return codes (the difference
 between False and None return codes).

Build 220-222 [0.13.0]
- Fixes and improvements to the help menus
- Update for Minecraft 1.12.1 packets
- commented out some debugging lines.

Build 219
- Issues with home and bookmark plugins not setting the location
 correctly, sometimes causing the player to fall or be slightly
 misplaced.  Due to specifying %d (and rounding 1/2 coords to change
 the TP location to an adjoining block).  Fix similar error in
 teleports.
- fine tune and verify packets for client and serverbound use.
- simplify constants for play states for proxy client and server.
- pass a faux player object to player.preLogin to prevent errors in
 trying to generate a playerobject before player is logged on.
- fixed player object login and logout.
- found error in Z position parse for SB playerposlook
- API was missing permission group management commands.  Added them
 to the base API:
  - createGroup(groupname)
  - deleteGroup(groupname)
  - addGroupPerm(group, node, value=True)
  - deleteGroupPerm(group, node)
  - resetGroups()  - deletes all group data
- added group manager plugin
- correct permissions.py error where creating a self.permissions =
 self.wrapper.permissions and later making self.permissions = {} breaks
 the association with wrapper.permissions.
- Correct more permissions errors.
- have wrapper commands.py echo back typed commands to the client user.

Build 218
- fix issues with a plugin called "Name" in help menus.
- permissions issues with bookmarks plugin allowing commands.
- Fix example and template plugins

Build 217
- more debugging with servervitals references.
- found a new 1.12 metadata data type.. cant parse it yet ('13' - nbt tag)

Build 216 [0.12.1]
- (reminder) player list was moved to core/wrapper.py.
-- however.. player list is passed back into servervitals for use
   by clientconnection
- Removed improper player references for self.servervitals

Build 215 [0.12.0]
- update packet information to minecraft version 1.12

Build 211
- Proxy is an independent system, save for some api.helpers dependencies.
 Proxy can now, in theory, be used without Wrapper as a stand-alone
 component for other uses.
- proxy is entirely refactored, separated proxy into several groups:
 - base.py file for main Proxy class
 - client, server, packets, utils, entity groups.
- Entity control moved to Proxy, where it belongs
- All wrapper and javaserver references finally removed.
- proxy passes information back to wrapper (or whatever system) via
 the shared data (for server and player data) or by calling events.
 The templates for these shared structures and API's are included as
 small classes in wrapper/proxy/base.py.
- Another goal of separation is to make the player api less confusing,
 since the documentation is not clear on what player API methods are
 available with/without proxy mode.  Hopefully, movement can be made
 to offer similar functionality for non-proxy mode (versus just
 generating errors when an attempt is made to access player
 data from the proxy).


Build 210 - Fully modularize and make Proxy an independent system:
- group encryption with proxy package (the only place it is used!).
- Group mcuuid.py into proxy package (proxy depends on it more than
 wrapper does... I would rather wrapper depend upon a proxy module
 than v.v.)
- clean up wrapper halt signal system to support separation of
 proxy from wrapper.  Also avert possible referencing errors in
 other places in code, like:
    - separate player.abort signal from the wrapper.halt.halt signal.
- create separate Proxy abort signal, separate from wrapper halt (the
 'caller' halt signal).
- separate out proxy and mcserver protocol versioning variables.
- proxy wrapper plugin channels are hardcoded to utf-8 (versus adding
 a whole proxy argument just for the channel's encoding!)


Build 209
- changed api/helpers _test() to use assertions for tests. Refactor helpers some.

Build 208
- Remove readchar package and implement simpler (better IMHO)
 readkey module.  Nothing functionally different from readchar
 package except that references and methods wrapper uses were
 updated accordingly. Implements all keys but ESC/F11/F12.
- Some Py3/Py2 updates to helpers.py
- move console output responsibility solely to core/wrapper to
 centralize printing to the console.  Logging is still using
 its own handler, though.
- finally have a real working version of console imput that
 fully supports a command history using up/down arrow keys
 as well as properly implements delete and backspace keys.

Build 205 - 207
These builds are all various experiments and re-writes of the
Readchar package and my attempts with implementing arrow keys
to have a command history, as well as improve or implement editing
functions (including the delete and backspace keys).

Build 204
 Nothing special:
 - update readchar package (hoping to get arrow keys working soon)
 - update wrapper's code to use modern new style python classes.

Build 203 [0.11.5]
- Add wrapper "op" command Feature Request:
    - Added two API minecraft items to makeOP() and deOp()
    - console and in-game command connections all use wrapper's
      op/deop API.  See documention in api minecraft.
- various bug fixes
    - fix set_item to allow adding new entries to a file.
    - tweaks here and there: converting to new classes, removing default
     '-r' arguments for file reading, etc.
    - clarify in code that what we called 'operatordict' in mcserver.py
     is actually a list (and is now renamed 'operator_list').
    - restore spawn object parsing (seems harmless since objects
     are GC-ed as entities)
    - remove some old debug and print statements.
    - Fix small error in in-game /help command.

Build 202
- fix backups issue #445 caused by defective indent in timer routine.
  (the timer.Second event would never run!)

Build 201
     Bugfixes!
- Bugfix registered_permissions.
- Bugfix group_delete method.
- Bugfix entity renaming (was using pre-1.11 in call cases).
- Correct bug in hasPermission that would set False the first time
  a user permission was checked (even if it was a default or None)
- Make help readout better.  Display the commands (but grayed out)
  so that users don't get blank help pages when they have no
  available commands on that page.

Build 200 [0.11.4]
- had to remove updates from grahamedgecombe.com because the website
  is not playing nice with our requests module.  This was a good thing
  due to major changes in names that needed to be addressed for 1.11
  versus pre-1.11 servers. 1.11 renames some mobs and also changes the
  naming scheme away from the old CamelCase (you can still /kill a
  Camel_Case, though!).  Some things renamed entirely, though; like
  PigZombie became zombie_pigman.

Build 199 [0.11.3]:
- Created new permissions code.
- Implement SuperOPs system of permissions above OP 4.

Build 197 -198:
- Just various bug fixes
- stage mew permissions code

Build 184-196 [0.11.2]
- Build 196:
    - Fix load_json and load_pickle functions which returned the values
      without actually updating the Data dictionary.
    - Clean up wrapper `__main__` code and add argument parsing to
      wrapper startup.  Added '--betterconsole' and '--encoding'.
    - changed build script to make incrementing builds an option.
Builds 184-196:
- Created new documentation system to document the API and
  the Wrapper.py events.

Build 183 Version [0.11.0]
- plugin-breaking change made to getStorage API:
    - Had to do it!  The Storages were really a bad implementation that tried to
      follow both Dict and json rules.  However, the implementation limits our
      ability to leverage the full capabilities of a Dict class, including being a
      fully compliant iterator object.  Further, by  implementing pickle methods,
      saving the storages can be much more reliable without being limited by the
      constraints of json formatting.  I have implemented the pickling (off by
      default for back-wards compatibility) with cPickle for Python 2 (Pickle is
      already C-implemented for Python 3).
    - This changes the use of Storages some.  The close() and save() methods are
      used as before. `data.save()`, `data.close()` ('data' being the Storage object)
    - The data component is accessed as `data.Data`.  Data is a fully compliant
      Python dictionary.

Build 182
- make `use-readline` default to True in the wrapper.config.json
- Bugfix server auto-restart options
- Clean up config some.
- Make entity tracker code more responsive to shutdowns (close threads quicker)

Build 181 Version [0.10.1]
- Fix bugs with shutdowns SIGINT, SIGTERM, SIGTSTP

Build 180 Version [0.10.0]
- packet API is changed (pre-release 'major' version increased).  Packet constants
    now have two fields (and are a list). The first field is the packet constant
    (such as 0x02).  The second field is the parsing definition ( for example,
    [JSON, BYTE]). Thus far, only applies to select play packets.
- Missing or added parsing definition fields between minecraft versions are handled (for some
    time now internally, anyway) by assigning a NULL type to the missing field.  For example,
    CHAT_MESSAGE is parsed using [JSON, BYTE] in 1.8 and later and [STRING, NULL]
    prior to 1.8.
- split proxy modules even more. mcpackets split into client-bound and server-bound.
    moved (and renamed) wrapper/utils/pkt_datatypes.py to proxy/constants.py.

Build 179
- Move play packets out of serverconnection to new parse_cb.py module.
- start code to add event documentation.
- refactor import of parsing constants using `from module import *` statements
- Started experiment (using KEEP_ALIVE): try making packet definitions include
 not just the packet constant, but their parsing formula as well.

Build 178
- bugfix - player.message was sending extra self argument.
- bugfix - removed encoding argument, which is not supported in json.dumps for py3 (in MCServer.broadcast)
- bugfix of serverconnection player.chatbox parse.
- Moved clientconnection play packet parsers to new module parse_sb.py

Build 176-177
- Fix a couple bugs:
    - fix broken encrytion for Python 2 introduced in build 175
    - fix entity iteration issues under Python 3

Build 175 Version [0.9.13]
- First completely working Python 3 version.  May not be entirely bug free,
 but any remaining problems are minor or infrequent and can be addressed as
 discovered.
- Pared down our version of encrytion strictly to the methods wrapper uses.

Build 174 Version
- Python 3 Bug fixes:
    - core.mcuuids.formatuuid()
    - core.wrapper.performupdate()
    - core.mcserver and core.commands - small typos/improvements

Build 173 Version [0.9.12]
- First Wrapper.py to successfully run on Python 3.  Following known Py3 probems:
    -proxy mode not working for py3
    -some uuid methods may still be bugged.
  wrapper does start from a fresh install, boots server, accepts EULA, and can read the console and issue commands.

Build 172 Version [0.9.11]
- FUN STUFF just for this build! - Babies are given nametags above their heads with their EID!
   (done to test the metadata code!)
- serious bugfix in packet.read_bool() where all booleans were always false. detected this while:
- bring entity metadata parsing up to date (new methods for 1.9+ added)
- implemented new 1.9 entity packet.read_metadata and packet.send_metadata.  These are suffixed as
   _1_9 (i.e., read_metadata_1_9).
- refactor the datatype constants for parsing to their own module (preparing for inclusion in API)

Build 171 Version [0.9.10]
- Finally bigfix wrapper /start /restart /stop /halt commands to an error-free state with serverStart flag properly set at shutdowns

Build 170 Version [0.9.9]
- turn of debug parsing by default.

Build 168-169 Version [0.9.9] * potential critical bugfix
- Completed entry of all known server-bound packets to mcpackets.py Found
    some problems in packet assignment that could cause packet confusion.

Build 167 Version [0.9.8]
- release wrapper from BBL license to GPL version 3 or later
- buildscript inserts LICENSE.txt into Wrapper.py at build time.

Build 166 Version [0.9.7]
- Documentation of API is created automatically as part of each build.
- Cleaned up web.py some.
- Cleaned up wrapper shutdown code.
- Completed entry of all known client-bound packets to mcpackets.py
- re-implement utils/helpers directly into api/helpers. Still contains
    private methods, but those are marked to prevent their inclusion in
    the documentation (or are prefixed with '_' to mark them as private
    methods.

Build 164-165 Version [0.9.6]
- Bugfix request import
- Big refactor of clientconnection parsing to remove all the if-elif processing.
- making code preparations to fix player.connect()
- fix more player-connnect stuff.  works in a limited fashion.  Respawn in new world glitches screen until player dies and respawns
    if player does not use /lobby to get back, strange things happen if he disconnects and rejoins.  /lobby does not re-connect to
    original server (packet length problems).
- Same refactor of serverconnection that was done to clientconnection...
- Changed player.usebed event.  The (head of the) bed position is passed as a payload item: "position" of x,y,z (parsed minecraft "position")
- therefore, getBedPostion was removed from the API.player
- fixed long-standing problem with wrapper offline mode connection.
- introduce item self.api.wrapperHalt() to the base API.  Shuts down wrapper entirely with exit code 0.
- add self.api.minecraft.getServerPackets(self, packets="CB") to the Minecraft API
- add self.api.minecraft.setLocalName(MojangUUID, desired_name, kick=True) to effect local server name changes.
- add self.api.minecraft.getUuidCache() which returns the wrapper's uuid cache.
- spiff up the documentation to make new API documentation automatic.
- New folder /documentation in repo for plugin API documentation

Build 163 Version [0.9.4]
- refactor packet.py
- rewrites and bug fixes to proxy system:
    - option to have ip bans simply drop the connection, making the server un-responsive
    to traffic from the banned address.
    - start cleaning up logon process in clientconnection.
    - fix broken offline wrapper logon process (may have contributed to player.connect() issues).
    - bigfix in ban-ip that excluded valid ipv4s from being banned.
    - fix broken isipbanned function in proxy.base.

Build 162 Version [0.9.3]
- BugFix: Added getEntityControl() to Minecraft API so plugins can actually access the new entity control methods (gasp!)
- Added getServerPath() to minecraft API (since server can be in other folders now and some plugins need to know this)
- Added utils.py Utils class to API.  These wrap some useful functions from utils.helpers.
- moved backup code out of server instance and put it in the main wrapper instance.
- removed getHelpers from api.base (added in build 121).  Being replaced by Utils class.

Build 161
- clean up example plugins.
- fix player death event death message (mcserver.py)
- Fix /playerstats command (bug in getAllPlayers)

Build 160 Version [0.9.2]
- More wrapper imports improvements to dependency import process
- Including more plugin documentation in example-plugins/example.py.
- Strip down example-plugins/template.py to the bare minimums for a plugin shell.
- Strip old 'Global' plugin dependency back out of teleport.py
- Wrapper now requires requests.  It is no longer optional based on usages (proxy-mode, etc).

Build 159
- Bugfix: - core.wrapper - renamed _shutdown() back to shutdown()

Build 158 Version [0.9.1]
refactor core.plugins module:
- Move some setup code to the init where it belongs.
- delete old plugin modules from sys.modules so they can be reloaded.  Fix issue #365.
- make import process cleaner, more elegant, give user better messages about missing dependencies.

Build 157 Version [0.9.0]
- refactor uuid and username methods out of core.wrapper and into new class UUIDS in core.mcuuid.py
- refactor commands and wrapper console commands section (make it easier to read)
- started updating master CHANGELOG.MD.
- fix update script and error in build script.  Justifies version 0.9.0

Build 156
- generate warnings on wrapper start for python versions below 2.7.
- move chattocolorcodes out of mcserver.py to utils/helpers.py where it can be properly debugged and refactored
- refactored and debugged mcserver broadcast()

Build 155
- third - fix clientconnection import errors when proxy is not used and pycrypto is not installed.

Build 154
- second (typo) - fix proxy errors when proxy is not used and pycrypto is not installed.

Build 152 - 153
- remove remaining pre-1.7 mode code.  Wrapper detects server version and adjusts accordingly.
- fix proxy errors when proxy is not used and pycrypto is not installed.

Build 151
- Minor PEP-8 and bugfix of utils/version.py
- Bugfixes to console parsing
- Modify the vanilla server's message to console about hackers connecting.

build 150
- changed server console parsing to be more independent of server versions
- refactored parsing of server output
- ... therefore, there is no "pre-1.7-mode" anymore and...
- Proxy mode automatically configures the server port to use from server output
- Proxy mode shuts off if version is pre-1.7.

Build 149  Version [0.8.18]
- BugFix broken "entity" command.
- neaten up server console parsing area.
- wrapper.py - separate the console input reading function out of the command parsing (add function getconsoleinput())
- Add "server.lagged" event which returns payload - "ticks": (number of ticks server skipped).
- Made entity processor speed configurable.
- toned down thinner code to kill less aggresively.  Merely "thins" half of any detected excess at each cycle.
- "kills" are actually "tp"'s, making the code cleaner and more reliable (server does not have to cycle doMobLoot gamerules)
- removed option to limit all mobs (it was killing item stacks and innocent mobs under certain circumstances.

Build 148
- make wrapper's output (logger.logging() and utils.helpers.readout() ) reserve the last line for user input as well.

Build 147 version [0.8.17]
- Added console mute (/cm) function to mute a spammy server or while running wrapper commands.
- More and more refactors and tweaks, like making 'ban' a server command again (versus wrapper proxy '.ban')
- add /perms to console help (the command already existed, but was not documented in help)
- OPs processing (make checking OPs less disk-intense):
    - removed operator file reads from the player object API and moved to the server object
    - OPs file is read ONCE by default, when server is instantiated, and at any starts and restarts.
    - a mcserver.py MCServer class method added to be able to refresh OPs list when changes are made.
    - The refresh_ops() will be wrapped in the player API as `refreshOpsList()` for convenience, but will obviously
     now refresh the list for ALL players.
    - isOp_fast() is removed due to not being needed (and no one probably EVER wrote a plugin dependent upon it).
- fix issue with wrapper's getuuidbyusername that could cause the person's local name on the server to revert unexpectedly.
- added neater way to read server properties and have them included in mcserver.py self.properties as a dictionary.
- add set_item() to utils.helpers.  This will allow wrapper to easily write new server.properties values to disk.
- add other nice helper functions.
- Added readchar package to utils and...
- Optional console input processing to read keystrokes (instead of waiting for /n readline) so that:
    - I can fix issue #326 https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/issues/326
    - make console input even fancier.
    - staged wrapper self variables to allow up/down arrow key command history.
- removed trace-level logging.
- staged some things to start work on the ability to restart a server and keep players connected in proxy mode.

Build 146
- custom startup/restart messages (#319)

Build #145 version [0.8.16]
- Implement 'Solutions for multiple plugins using a single wrapper event' #277
- Implement "player.rawMessage" payload needs consistency of return values #340
- Pulled update items out of General config and made them their own group.
- added config item to change command prefix to something other than a '/' slash (#319)

Build #144 
- refactor API's world and entity:
    * api.entity (class EntityControl) is now the actual Entity api versus the internal tracking methods, which are now
    moved to the core.entities module.
    * removed entity api methods from api.world to api.entity.
- Added:
```
    def getGameRules(self):
        """

        returns: a dictionary of gamerules.

        """
```

Build #143
Bugfix: forgot to change api/world references to "Gameplay"/"Entities" section.

Build #142
- spammy console solution started.
- quick and dirty build to move Entity config items to it's own group:
```
"Entities": {
        "enable-entity-controls": False,  # enable entity controls.
        "thinning-frequency": 10,  # how often thinning of mobs runs, in seconds
        "thinning-activation-threshhold": 100,  # when TOTAL mobs are below this number, thinning is skipped entirely
        "thin-any-mob": 50,  # any mob count above this number gets thinned.
        "thin-Cow": 30,  # Example, keeps Cows < 30.  Name must match exactly.  Overrides 'thin-any-mob'.
        "thin-Sheep": 30,
        "thin-Chicken": 30 },
```

Build #141
- added entity controls which are configurable.

Build #140
- Fix error in serverconnection.py:
new entities that have been added to MC version 1.11 are not yet listed in the grahamedgecombe resource.  This
results in the parse referencing an entity type ID number that does not exist in the entity type dictionary. Adjusted
code to skip such non-conforming entries.

Build #139
- Fix backups for other-folder servers.
- correct error in config that was not removing deprecated entries.
- Give the console player its own __str__ method to display "CONSOLE OPERATOR" versus <object...> stuff in wrapper.infos

Build #138  [0.8.15]
- fix the player.logout (def logout in mcserver.py) to pass a player-type object for parsing of the 'player.username'
upon exiting for the example.py plugin.  No idea what other items from player payload are in use, but they can be added
later to the MiniPlayer class.  The actual player object becomes defunct before it reaches the plugin event.
- fixed redundant logic in clientconnection.py.  Verified wrapper still functions in Proxymode for 1.11 pre-1.

Build #137  [0.8.14]
- Fix build 135's problem with sys.stdin.readline()... it needs additional .strip() to be equivalent to raw_input.
- updated the Cougar teleports.py plugin for the new wrapper logic (whichs returns None for non-existing getPlayer()'s.

Build #136
- core config.py:
    * add config items for updates.
    * correct potential for dictionary changes during iteration while detecting changes.
    * added code to remove deprecated items from the config
    * added more comments to the new default config dictionary.
- finish out updates and versioning that was in an intermediate state (switching things like "build" to "__build__")
- implement SurestTexas00 #25 by JasonBristol to add wrapper update URLs to wrapper config
- continuing refactor of core/wrapper.py
- restore timer.tick event, but it is only enabled by a new config item in new section "Gameplay".
- Fix gameplay proxy server issues caused by build 133-134

Build #135
- refactor core.wrapper.py.  Reorganize wrapper imports for readability, grouping by function.
- make console display the ConsolePlayer.message() using the passed color codes (&_) or json "color": item.
- make utils.helpers.readout() even more generic and configurable.
- refactor to remove various camelCase in various non-API places.
- remove old raw_input (py2) and input (py3) in favor of sys.stdin.readline().  It's cleaner and works well for all
    python versions (at least after 2.6).

Build 133 - 134
- Starting attempts to fix player.connect() and lobby functions.
- 134 build works with these known problems:
    1) wrapper hub can connect player to second server, but Server does not send player packets to
    position (clear "download terrain") or "respawn".  The player must die to spawn into the world.
    2) After that, it works great, until the player leaves and tries to rejoin. The second joining seems to
    "remember" too much about the last connection
The purpose of these builds is to progressively work towards full functionality.  Each build will be better
than the last until player.connect() is fully functional.

Build #132 [0.8.13]
- Fix circular-referencing Client() class- the final argument to Client() was the client's own instance (from proxy)
- some minor refractors and edits here and there

Build #131 [0.8.12]
- Fix some broken help functionality

Build #130 [0.8.12]
- Added /kill command to console and improved error checking some more.
- Added api.minecraft function "configWrapper" to allow plugin control of wrapper configuration
- Added /config command to console (and in-game OPs) to modify the wrapper properties configuration.
- improved the readout display for console operators on some help items that use the console player.message function.
- made helpers.format_bytes more generic for future use in other modules (like web or IRC).

Build #129 [0.8.11]
- Added feature to display memory in both raw bytes and a shortened, more readable, version using appropriate
 units (KiB, MiB, GiB).

Build #128 [0.8.11]
- Refactor core.plugins.py, modularizing the various portions of the 'eachsecond' method for external use.
- create api.backups.py as a publicly accessible `self.api.backups` backup interface for plugins:
```
    def verifyTarInstalled(self):
        """checks for tar on users system."""
    def performBackup(self):
        """Perform an immediate backup"""
    def pruneBackups(self):
        """prune backups according to wrapper properties settings."""
    def disableBackups(self):
        """Allow plugin to temporarily shut off backups (only during this wrapper session)."""
    def enableBackups(self):
        """Allow plugin to re-enable disabled backups or enable backups during this wrapper session."""
    def adjustBackupInterval(self, desired_interval):
        """Adjust the backup interval for automatic backups."""
    def adjustBackupsKept(self, desired_number):
        """Adjust the number of backups kept."""
```

Build #127 [0.8.10]
- This was a previous snake_case build of build 128's Backups API.
```
Wrapper's orginal convention throughtout the codebase has been camelCase from the begining.  The internal code
should be converted (going forward) to snake_case per PEP-8.
However, PEP-8 also acknowledges that:

'mixedCase is allowed only in contexts where that's already the prevailing style (e.g. threading.py), to retain
backwards compatibility.'

This is certainly the case with the wrapper plugin API.  Converting the entire plugin API to snake_case will
break all existing plugins.  Creating the backups API with snake_case will create an inconsitent `look 'n feel` within
the API.  The only other alternative would be to create excessive wrappers between oldFunctions and new_functions
(and does not serve to remove the oldFunctions anyway!)
```

Build #126 [0.8.9]
- Fixed problems with last serverState not being saved properly.
- Renamed serverState to ServerStarted for clarity with regards to its boolean values.
- Fixed lots of other bugs in the start/stop functions, especially an error that could start the server twice.
- Added error checks to prevent /start/stop/restart where not appropriate (starting an already running server, etc).

Build #125 [0.8.9]
- Ensure ban commands are only handled by wrapper in proxy mode.
- Fix broken build script that was not zipping the files properly.

Build #121 [0.8.7]
- storages have a close() method, which also saves the storage. This is to be called on plugin unload.
- corrected the example plugins from save() to close().
- Added 'def getHelpers(self, attribute, yourname="callingPlugin")' to api.base.  Allow plugin API access to functions in utils.helpers.
- completed the basic entity API (api.world):
```
    def countActiveEntities(self):
        """ return a count of all entities. """
    def getEntityInfo(self, eid):
        """ get dictionary of info on the specified EID.  Returns None if fails
    def existsEntityByEID(self, eid):
        """ A way to test whether the specified eid is valid """
    def killEntityByEID(self, eid, dropitems=False, finishstateof_domobloot=True, count=1):
        """ takes the entity by eid and kills the entity [...] "
    plus original: def getEntityByEID(self, eid):
        """ Returns the entity context or False if the specified entity ID doesn't exist."""
```
- Fix various errors and improved the entity processing.
- Added (more) entity management commands to console.
- improve and debug Storage.py.
- Optimizations and improvements to all of proxy. Notably:
    --better, smoother cleanup of player logouts.
    --made the 10 second delay ONLY apply when proxy could NOT bind (player logins were delayed 10 seconds previously).
    --improved the packet flushes using pop() instead of cycling through the packetlist and then setting it to [] (and hope new packets did nto arrive while going throught list!)
    --fixed disconnect messages and standardized to ALL use string text. color and bold options exist for disconnect()
    --server and client don't fight to try and shut each other down in circular manner when connections are lost.
- Fixed a few parsing bugs in serverconnection.py.
- removed proprietary/copyrighted Django code (six and termcolors).

Build #120 [0.8.6]

- lots of  internal refactoring.
- Fix smallbrother.py plugin #284 and #240
- restore api.minecraft.lookupUUID(uuid) to it's former 0.7.x behavior that returns a dictionary of the "uuid": and "name":.
- renamed the newer lookupUUID(name) and lookupName(uuid) to lookupbyName(name) and lookupbyUUID(uuid) respectively.

Build #119 [0.8.5]

- Separate path for server outside the wrapper folder supported.  Wrapper folder remains unchanged and by default, the server uses the wrapper folder too, as it always has.
    - there is no need to modify the start command in wrapper.properties.json; wrapper automatically prefixes the server path.
    - getStorage() method still takes the second (world=True) argument to put a storage object in the world (server) folder, so data can stay server-specific.
    - This also means you should not attempt to run a server as wrapper startup arguments (like `python /home/surest/MyServer/wrapper java -jar minecraft_server.1.9.2.jar nogui`).  Wrapper needs to parse the server command from wrapper.properties.json.

Build #118 [0.8.4]
- Fixed serious bug fix for wrapper.getusernamebyuuid() that will prevent new players from joining.
- Refactored config.py to use pure json (updates wrapper.properties to wrapper.properties.json).

Build #117 [0.8.3.1]
- bug fix # [SurestTexas00 #183 - 'Unable to launch'](https://github.com/suresttexas00/minecraft-wrapper/issues/183) caused by invalid PY2 argument 'exist_ok=' for os.makedirs().
- centralize the mkdir_p function to utils.helpers.
- make wrapper a little more verbose about why it can't start.
- prevent infinite loop server re-starts when wrapper cannot start a server.
- allow a few restarts to try setting EULA and server.properties

Build #116 [0.8.3]:

- [Capturing bed sleeping / right click #146](https://github.com/benbaptist/minecraft-wrapper/issues/146)
_____________________________________
- Added "player.usebed" event.  It has no payload other than the player object.  Functions purely to notify plugins that... 
- new player method getBedPostion() can get the location where the player slept.  Wrapper does not store this between client restarts!
______________________________________
- Eliminate some unneeded packet parsing.
- Add entity destroy packet to mcpacket (for future entity work)
- Proxy mode will now work with all (unmodded) minecraft versions from 1.7.2 - 1.9.4
- Fixed isOp to function in pre-1.7.6 (reads ops.json or ops.txt, depending on server version).
- Fix wrapper inventory by parsing client CLICK_WINDOW packets
- Immediately populate a logged on players EID and location (for proxy client) from the mcserver.py console parse.
- Fix lots of packet parsing problems, most of which were due to not parsing correctly for a given version.   This fixes a __lot__ of random disconnect issues.
- Implemented packet sets for mcpacket.py for ALL versions 1.7 to 1.9
- Added a (maybe temporary) slot parsing read_slot_nbtless() for cases where our parsing of the nbt slot data is not working (1.7 minecrafts).
- Added a "lastLoggedIn" item to player data.
- Implemented sendBlock (the unfinished function "setBlock") to place phantom client side only blocks.
- Removed the threaded periodicsave from Storage.  Plugin periodic saves (if desired) should be run on "ontimer".  Every plugin should already be using save() somewhere in the code anyway (like during "onDisable"). 
- added \_\_Del__ saves to various modules to implement Storage object save()'s.
- Removed deprecated proxy-storage.  Bans are stored in the server files and wrapper uses usercache for username caches.
- Add error checking to alert for player object that cannot get a client in proxy mode.
- Entities dynamically updated from http://minecraft-ids.grahamedgecombe.com on a monthly basis, if available.
- block tiles for minecraft.py are also fetched from grahamedgecombe.com.
- Destroyed entities are parsed and removed from world entities collection to await garbage collection.
- new file core.entities.py replaces items from api.entity and core.items.
- Add getOfflineUUID to player api to get an offline (local server) uuid.
- Implemented a full Entity manager with blocking locks.
- Completed kill entity by eid methods
- added the /entity command to the console and wrapper in-game commands.
- added Objects class (non-living entities that behave as blocks too). No dynamic source (yet), but primed to do so.
- fixed problems with getuuidfromname usage/implementations
- added and improved several Entity-related api.Minecraft and api.world methods.



##### update Packet read and send methods: #####
_____________________________________
read and send are now abstraction wrappers for readpkt and sendpkt.

readpkt and sendpkt are lower-level methods that eliminate the use of
string arguments like "double:xposition|double:yposition|double:zposition|bool:on_ground".

Arguments for read (like the example cited) are reduced simply to number codes (constants)
for the desired data types to be returned (i.e., 8 for "double").  Instead, in the example
cited, the readpkt argument would simply be '[8, 8, 8, 10]'.  Of course, the numbers can be
abstracted with constants for readability.  readpkt() returns a __list__ of the results in the
same order as the numbers/constants were passed.  The reading function can decide what variable names
to assign based on their list position:

```
# as used in the server or client: 
data = ["server.."].packet.readpkt([_DOUBLE, _DOUBLE, _DOUBLE, _BOOL])  # even for single arguments the [] take care of typing it as list
x, y, z, on_ground = data
# or
x = data[0]  # even if this were a single element, you must still use the index because a list gets returned.
```

similarly, packet.sendpkt() is a bit like the original send()/packet.send(), except that the
field types are abstracted numbers too and don't need the slicing operations to get the
arguments (the payload portion does not change, but must be a list or tuple).

The primary aim of these changes is to remove un-needed string operations while preserving
readability in the code.  This code is run in high frequency on a packet stream.. The
unneeded string parsing operations and the overly fancy use of slower dictionary methods
needs to be limited in this high-use code to improve wrapper's speed.


Build #114 [0.8.1]:
- A completely new rewrite.  Fully compatible with x.7.x version plugins _if_ they do not dip into wrapper's internal methods and stick strictly to the previously documented API:
http://wrapper.benbaptist.com/docs/api.html
- Methods in the client/server (like sending packets) are different.  Plugins doing this will need to be modified. Using the wrapper permissions or other wrapper components directly (self.wrapper.permissions, etc) by plugins will be broken with this version.

API changes Summary:

[Minecraft]

- lookupName (uuid) Get name of player with UUID "uuid"
- lookupUUID (name) Get UUID of player "name" - both will poll Mojang or the wrapper cache and return _online_ versions
- ban code methods added (bannUUID, banName, banIp, pardonName, pardonUUID, pardonIp, isUUIDBanned, isIpBanned)
- when using the proxy mode banning system, be aware that the server has it's own version in memory that was loaded on startup... if you run a minecarft ban or pardon, it will overwrite the disk with _its_ version!  Once the server restarts, the wrapper proxy changes on disk are safe and permanent.
[Player]

- ".name" and ".uuid" are deprecated properties that reference ".username" and ".mojangUuid" respectively.
- added player .offlineUuid (offline server UUID) and .ipaddress (the actual IP from proxy) self variables.
- quicker isOp_fast() - similar to .isOP(), but does not read ops.json file each time.  For use in iterative loops where re-reading a file is a performance issue.  Refreshes at each player login.
- refreshOps() - refresh isOp_fast dictionary.
- sendCommand(self, command, args) -Sends a command to the wrapper interface as the player.  Similar to execute, but will execute wrapper commands.  Example: `player.sendCommand("perms", ("users", "SurestTexas00", "info"))`
- self.clientboundPackets / serverboundPackets - contain the packet class constants being used by wrapper.  Usage example: `player.getClient().packet.send(player.clientboundPackets.PLAYER_ABILITIES,
"byte|float|float", (bitfield, self.fly_speed, self.field_of_view))` renaming these in the plugin code is fine:
```
pktcb = player.clientboundPackets
player.getClient().packet.send(pktcb.PLAYER_ABILITIES ...)
```
- setPlayerAbilities(self, fly) - pass True to set player in flying mode.
- added event "player.Spawn" - occurs after "player.login"; when the player actually spawns (i.e., when the player actaully sees something other than the "login, building terrain..").  This is a good place for plugins to start gathering information like player.position and such because it gives the proxy time to bather those items.  The "player.login" happens too soon for proxy to gather information on many player variables...

Broad-spectrum summary of changes:

[Re-vamped console interface]

- added ban commands (ban-ip, ban, pardon, pardon-ip)
- colorized the menus/helps (does not use log statements for display)
- minimal console player class added to wrapper.  Console has a fake "player" class that mimicks player methods and variables.  Presently, this allows the in-game wrapper menus and the console commands to share common methods, so that separate code is not needed to do things like... 
- Add /perms to console commands!  Add /playerstats also.. (the player.message() components of the in-game commands are passed to the console as colored print statements).

[wrapper structure in general]

- Wrapper was split into 5 modules and is prepped for packaging.
- Dashboard files were placed in a Management module.
- New utility classes were added (/utils): 
 -- encryption.py
 -- log.py
 -- termcolors.py (colored console logging!)
 -- six.py (PY3 <=> PY2 compatibility code)
 -- helpers.py (centralized high use code snippets).
 
- The logging system utilized in wrapper was overhauled and is now thread safe and features an additional level TRACE for packet tracing and other low level information. With this overhaul, the logging configuration settings were stripped out of wrapper.properties and an extended version now resides in logging.json.
- The proxy was split into individual modules instead of one large one.
 -- base.py - General functions, including various ban methods.
 -- mcpacket.py - contains general packet abstraction classes.  Defines critical-change version-to-protocol number references, start and stop points to define a given packet set, etc. Contains packet sets for all wrapper-supported minecraft versions.
 -- packet.py - old packet class; send/receive packets.
 -- clientconnection.py - old Client class.
 -- serverconnection.py - old proxy Server class (not the console server.py!)
 
- Creation of /core group where most core wrapper items reside.  Base wrapper source folder just has `__init__.py` and `__main__.py`.
- Old log.py removed in favor of newer one using the built-in logging module
- trace level logging of packet parsing is available

features/other changes:

- wrapper handles all it's own ban code for the server.
- temporary bans are available (uses the "expires" field in the ban files!)
- wrapper fully handles keepalives between client and server. technically, we are moving towards the separation of client and server that could allow future functions like server restarts that don't kick players, cleaner transfers to other server instances, and a "pre-login" lobby where player can interact with wrapper before wrapper logs the player onto the server...

- Split plugin, command, and event code into separate respectively-named files/classes for cleaner code
- Fixed nobody being able to connect via proxy with oddly-formatted whitelist.json
- `/permissions groups [group] info` now shows usernames alongside UUID [surresttexas00/#145]
- `/permissions users [username] remove` sub-command added [surresttexas00/#148]
- Fixed `player.hasGroup` always returning None [issue #144]
- Fixed `/help` command showing two pages when only four items are listed [issue #141]
- Passing a list or tuple as the command name to api.registerCommand for easily registering multiple aliases for a command [issue #135]
- Commands are no longer case-sensitive [issue #135]
- Removed bolding on `/help` command groups [issue #121]
- Proxy config option `convert-player-files` is now False by default until fixed

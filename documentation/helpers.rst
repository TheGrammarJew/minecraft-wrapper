**< class Helpers >**

This is not actually a class at all, but a module collection of
Wrapper's helpful utilities.

This module is imported with the core API and is accessible
using 'self.api.helpers'

    .. code:: python

        # can be accessed directly:
        self.api.helpers.getargs(args, 2)

        # or a local reference to the module in your plugin:
        <yourobject> = self.api.helpers
        <yourobject>.getargs(args, 2)

    ..

        ..

    

-  set_item(item, string_val, filename, path='.')

    Reads a file with "item=" lines and looks for 'item'. If
    found, it replaces the existing value with 'item=string_val'.
    Otherwise, it adds the entry, creating the file if need be.

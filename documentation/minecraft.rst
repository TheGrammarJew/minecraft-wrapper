    This class contains functions related to in-game features
    directly. These methods are accessed using 'self.api.minecraft'

    
-  banIp(self, ipaddress, reason="by wrapper api.", source="minecraft.api", expires=False)

        Ban an ip address using the wrapper proxy system. Messages
        generated by process can be directed to a particular player's
        client or to the Console (default). Ban will fail if it is not
        a valid ip4 address.

        :args:

                :ipaddress: IP address to ban
                :reason: Optional text reason
                :source: Source (author/op) of ban.
                :expires: Optional expiration in time.time() format.

        :returns: String describing the operation's outcome.
         If there is no proxy instance, nothing is returned.

        
-  banName(self, playername, reason="by wrapper api.", source="minecraft.api", expires=False)

        Ban a player using the wrapper proxy system.  Will attempt to
        poll or read cache for name. If no valid name is found, does a
        name-only ban with offline-hashed uuid

        :args:

                :playername: Player's name... specify the mojangUuid for online
                 ban and offlineUuid for offline bans.

                :reason: Optional text reason.

                :source: Source (author/op) of ban.

                :expires: Optional expiration in time.time() format.
                 Expirations only work when wrapper handles the login
                 (proxy mode).. and only for online bans.

        :returns: String describing the operation's outcome.
         If there is no proxy instance, nothing is returned.

        
-  banUUID(self, playeruuid, reason="by wrapper api.", source="minecraft.api", expires=False)

        Ban a player using the wrapper proxy system.

        :args:

                :playeruuid: Player's uuid... specify the mojangUuid
                 for online ban and offlineUuid for offline bans.

                :reason: Optional text reason.

                :source: Source (author/op) of ban.

                :expires: Optional expiration in time.time() format.
                 Expirations only work when wrapper handles the login
                 (proxy mode).. and only for online bans.

        :returns: String describing the operation's outcome.
         If there is no proxy instance, nothing is returned.

        
-  broadcast(self, message="", irc=False)

        Broadcasts the specified message to all clients connected.
        message can be a JSON chat object, or a string with formatting
        codes using the & as a prefix. Setting irc=True will also
        broadcast the specified message on IRC channels that Wrapper.py
        is connected to. Formatting might not work properly.

        :Args:
            :message:  The message
            :irc: Also broadcast to IRC if set to True.

             permission.
            :name_to_deop: The player to de-op.  Must match what is
             in superops.txt to remove superOP perms, but may deop

        the server started! modulus the value by 24000 to get the time.

        :returns: Returns the time of the world in ticks.

        
-  getTimeofDay(self, dttmformat=0)

        get the "virtual" world time of day on the server.

        :arg dttmformat: 0 = ticks, 1 = Military, (else = civilian AM/PM).

            :ticks: are useful for timebased- events (like spawing
             your own mobs at night, etc).
            :Miliary/civilian: is useful for player displays.

        :returns: The appropriately formatted time string

        
-  getUuidCache(self)

        Gets the wrapper uuid cache.  This is as far as the API goes.
        The format of the cache's contents are undefined by this API.

         for the running server instance

        
-  getWorldName(self)

        Returns the world's name.  If worldname does not exist (server

-  getplayerby_eid(self, eid)

        Returns the player object of the specified logged-in player.
        Will raise an exception if the player is not logged in.

        :arg eid: EID of the player

        :returns: The Player Class object for the specified EID.
         If the EID is not a player or is not found, returns False

        :returns: Nothing; runs in console

        
-  isIpBanned(self, ipaddress)

        Check if a ipaddress is banned.  Using this method also
        refreshes any expired bans and unbans them.

        :arg ipaddress: Check if an ipaddress is banned

        :returns: True or False (banned or not banned).
         If there is no proxy instance, nothing is returned.

-  lookupUUID(self, uuid)

        Returns a dictionary of {"uuid: the-uuid-of-the-player,
        "name": playername}. legacy function from the old 0.7.7 API.

        lookupbyUUID() is a better and more direct way to get the
        name from a uuid.

        :arg uuid:  player uuid

        :returns: a dictionary of two items, {"uuid: <player-uuid>,
         "name": <playername>}

        
-  lookupbyName(self, name)

        Returns the UUID from the specified username.
        If the player has never logged in before and isn't in the
        user cache, it will poll Mojang's API.  The function will
        return False if the name is invalid.

        :arg name:  player name

        :returns: a UUID object (wrapper type MCUUID)

        Remember to use the MCUUID.string to get a string when
         using this for string purposes (json keys)!

        
-  lookupbyUUID(self, uuid

        Returns the username from the specified UUID.
        If the player has never logged in before and isn't in the user
        cache, it will poll Mojang's API.  The function will return
        False if the UUID is invalid.

        :arg uuid: string uuid with dashes

        :returns: username

        
-  makeOp(self, nametoOP, argslist, playerObj=None)

        Ops player 'nametoOP'.  Case sensitivity and other
        bahaviors of the command vary with server status and
        the arguments to 'argslist'

        :nametoOP: Name of player to OP.

        :playerObj: This is the player that receives the command's
         output.  Setting 'None' uses the console operator (and
         permissions!). This player object must have OP level 10
         permission.

        :Valid args for argslist:
            :-s: make player superop.txt entry.  Player will still
             not be superOP unless given appropriate level.
            :-o: use offline name and uuid.  This option only
             works if the server is not running!  Otherwise,
             the server uses its' default (depending on server
             mode).
            :-l: Flag for next argument to be a number
             corresponding to the desired level.  If the server is
             running, this argument only superops.txt is updated.
             if server is not running, the json.ops is also
             updated (to a maximum level of 4).
            :<number>: A number corresponding to the desired
             '-l' level.  These are two separate arguments and
             this number must be the next argument after -l in
             the list.

        :Notes:
            - Json.ops controls minecraft server permissions.
              This command CAN alter json.ops if the server is
              not running.
            - superops.txt controls wrapper commands, INCLUDING
              proxy ban commands.

        :returns: Nothing.  All output is directed to playerObj.

        
-  message(self, destination="", jsonmessage="")

        Used to message some specific target.

        :Args:
            :destination: playername or target
             selector '@a', 'suresttexas00' etc
            :jsonmessage: strict json chat message

        :returns: Nothing; succeeds or fails with no programmatic indication.

        
-  pardonIp(self, ipaddress)

        Pardon an IP.

        :arg ipaddress: a valid IPV4 address to pardon.

        :returns:  String describing the operation's outcome.
         If there is no proxy instance, nothing is returned.

        
-  pardonName(self, playername)

        Pardon a player.

        :arg playername:  Name to pardon.

        :returns: String describing the operation's outcome.
         If there is no proxy instance, nothing is returned.

        
-  pardonUUID(self, playeruuid)

        Pardon a player by UUID.

        :arg playeruuid:  UUID to pardon

        :returns: String describing the operation's outcome.
         If there is no proxy instance, nothing is returned.

        
-  refreshOpsList(self)

        OPs list is read from disk at startup.  Use this method
        to refresh the in-memory list from disk.

        
-  setBlock(self, x, y, z, tilename, datavalue=0, oldblockhandling="replace", datatag=None)

        :returns: Nothing.

        
-  setLocalName(self, MojangUUID, desired_name, kick=True)

        Set the local name on the server.  Understand that this
        may cause a vanilla server UUID change and loss of player
        data from the old name's offline uuid.

        
-  summonEntity(self, entity, x=0, y=0, z=0, datatag=None)

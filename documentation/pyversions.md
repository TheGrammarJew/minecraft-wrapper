###  **Python Versions**

Python 3.5 or higher is the recommended Python version to use with Wrapper.

*Wrapper is only designed to be compatible with Python 3.4+ and python 2.7+ versions (Using a python 2.7 version below 2.7.11 is also _not_ recommended)

*It may run under python 2.6, but this is untested and may cause errors.  Certain Linux distros with Python 2.7 also have known issues with the requests module.*

:Event: "player.rawMessage"

    :Can be aborted/modified: Yes
    :Comments:

:Event: "player.runCommand"

    :Module: parse_sb.py *(client/parse_sb.py)*

    :Description:

         config as the command cursor).
        :"args": the remaining words/args

    :Can be aborted/modified: Yes. Registered commands ARE already aborted since they do not get passed to the server.
    :Comments:
        Called AFTER player.rawMessage event (if rawMessage
        does not reject it).  However, rawMessage could have
        modified it before this point.
        
        The best use of this event is a quick way to prevent a client from
        passing certain commands or command arguments to the server.
        rawMessage is better if you need something else (parsing or
        filtering chat, for example).

:Event: "player.dig"

    :Module: parse_sb.py *(client/parse_sb.py)*

    :Description:
        When a player attempts to dig.  This event
        only supports starting and finishing a dig.

    :Payload:
        :"playername": playername (not the player object!)
        :"position": x, y, z block position
        :"action": begin_break or end_break (string)
        :"face": 0-5 (bottom, top, north, south, west, east)

    :Can be aborted/modified: Yes
    :Comments:
        Can be aborted by returning False. Note that the client
        may still believe the block is broken (or being broken).
        If you intend to abort the dig, it should be done at
        "begin_break". Sending a false bedrock to the client's
        digging position will help prevent the client from
        sending "end_break"

:Event: "player.interact"

    :Module: parse_sb.py *(client/parse_sb.py)*

        Called when the client is eating food,

        :"action": "finish_using"  or "use_item"
        :"origin": Debugging information on where event was parsed.

    :Can be aborted/modified: Yes
    :Comments:
        Can be aborted by returning False. Note that the client
        may still believe the action happened, but the server
        will act as though the event did not happen.  This
        could be confusing to a player.  If the event is aborted,
        consider some feedback to the client (a message, fake
        particles, etc.)

:Event: "player.place"

    :Module: parse_sb.py *(client/parse_sb.py)*

    :Description:
        Called when the client places an item

    :Comments:

        may still believe the action happened, but the server
        will act as though the event did not happen.  This
        could be confusing to a player.  If the event is aborted,
        consider some feedback to the client (a message, fake
        block, etc.)

:Event: "player.createSign"

    :Comments:
        Can be aborted by returning False.
        Any of the four line arguments can be changed by
        returning a dictionary payload containing the lines
        you want replaced:
        
        `return {"line2": "You can't write", "line3": "that!"}`

:Event: "player.slotClick"

    :Can be aborted/modified: Yes
    :Comments:

        since that is how wrapper keeps tabs on inventory.

        :"json": json or string data

    :Comments:

        to the client instead.
